# Basic NLP Projects

Welcome to the **Basic NLP Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly projects that demonstrate various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Through these projects, we explore key NLP tasks such as text processing, sentiment analysis, and text classification.

## Projects Overview

1. **Text Preprocessing with NLTK**  
   Mastered the fundamentals of text preprocessing using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). This includes tasks such as tokenization, stop word removal, stemming, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging.

2. **Sentiment Analysis with NLTK**  
   Built a sentiment analysis model using NLTK's VADER sentiment analyzer. This project showcases how to classify text as positive, neutral, or negative based on polarity scores.

3. **Introduction to Hugging Face Transformers**  
   Got introduced to Hugging Face's powerful `transformers` library. This project covers how to use pre-trained models like BERT and GPT for tasks such as text classification and text generation.

4. **Fine-tuning a Pre-trained Transformer**  
   Fine-tuned a pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face on a custom dataset. Learned how to adapt a pre-trained model for a specific NLP task, such as question answering or summarization.
